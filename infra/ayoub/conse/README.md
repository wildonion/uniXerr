# 🏗 Conse PaaS

Conse is an AI based Crypto Game Event Manager Platform on top of coiniXerr blockchain. 

### 📌 WIP

* HAProxy, dockerizing, k8s-ing and ci/cd in `app.sh`

* all TODOs inside the app

* communication between Conse and the coiniXerr must be done through the TCP stream since coiniXerr supports TCP stream.

* an AI model which suggests player the tips and tricks for a new game based on behavioural graph of the player collected by the history of each event's `phases` field

* coin generation based on player scores which are collected by each event manager inside the game, then update the balance field of the user based on that
