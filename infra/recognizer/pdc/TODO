ðŸ“Œ fix backpropagation algorithm, the issue with the size of each weights (weights updating process issue for mlp model)
ðŸ“Œ train MLP and CNN params (weights and biases) using GA(ES)
ðŸ“Œ build the confusion matrix (TN, FP, FN and TP) and scores (accuracy, precision, recall and f1 scores) from valid (test) data after training is over
ðŸ“Œ building the prediction bot (complete bot.py script)
ðŸ“Œ create docker services for the bot server using docker-compose file
ðŸ“Œ complete README (link to backward function and docker setup) and
ðŸ“Œ final push
