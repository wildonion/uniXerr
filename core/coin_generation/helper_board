✅ fuzzy generative multi-task classification is the same as multi-class classification with softmax in the last layer
✅ simple fuzzy is used for regression like our following coin generation ideas 
✅ combining evolutionary algorithms like GA (ES) and FA for best rules selection or rules learning or membership function creation of fuzzy logic controller
✅ a hybrid intelligence for updating parameters of an expert system based on neuro-fuzzy classifier like ANFIS using GA (ES) and FA 
✅ if classes are mutually exclusive, then the sum of the fuzzy membership degrees for these classes should typically be equal to 1.
✅ The classes are mutually exclusive when there is not intersection between them: every input object belongs only to ONE class. 
   When the (mutually exclusive) classes are only two, you have a binary classification problem, while if the classes are more than two, 
   you have a multi-class classification problem. When the classes are not mutually exclusive, i.e. every object can have multiple labels, 
   you have a multi-label classification problem. You can use NNs for both types of problem (this makes the claim in your answer false). 
   For multi-class classification, one typically uses a softmax output layer with cross-entropy loss (a softmax classifier).
   A multi-label classifier can be seen as a stack of “independent” binary classifiers. So, if you want to implement a multi-label NN classifier, 
   all you need to do is replacing the softmax classifier at the end of your net with C logistic units (where C is the number of classes), 
   each working as a binary classifier responsible for one single label.
✅ example of different classification tasks
   Fuzzy or multi-class classification: [0.5, 0.2, 0.3, 0, 0]
   Single-label classification:         [1,   0,   0,   0, 0]
   Multi-label classification:          [1,   0,   1,   0, 0]
✅ Mutually Exclusive Classes:
   none-overlapping classes 
   every instance belongs to one class only at a time
   Fuzzy Classification
   Multi-class Classification on Neural Network Classifier with softmax at the last layer
   Sum of fuzzy membership degrees for the classes are equal to 1
✅ Not Mutually Exclusive Classes:
   overlapping classes
   every instance can belongs to multiple classes at the same time
   Binary or single-label Classification
   Multi-label Classification on Neural Network Classifier with sigmoid at the last layer
   Sum of fuzzy membership degrees for the classes are not equal to 1
