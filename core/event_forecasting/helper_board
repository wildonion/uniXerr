        create a system for collage students those who their state is a 
        little bit close to conditional situation but they passed all their 
        courses in that semester; so we can help them by this system in order to 
        give them either a conditional state or passed state by taking a process 
        time for investigating and collecting big data about their 
        manner, behavior, personality, efforts for each semester 
        and other majors of their past life then mine those data
        using AI and let the AI say us what'll happen!
