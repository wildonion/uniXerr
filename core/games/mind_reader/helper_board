CONNECT GAME IMPLEMENTATION
---------------------------

connect game in python.
it'll listen to the player which he/she said a SilentPhonetic
then this bot will give us a word using DRL model
in which its two first letter match with the player's letters
that he/she just said. after making a connection to someone
this bot will counting in a reverse manner and say the word. 
this bot should connect to other players in such a way that 
defeat the player in first round!  
we need a pattern to read other players mind to know their
manners, behaviours and thoughts with this bot
we need to get the players voice then convert them into words
