    ➤ create best objective function to find the most rewarded (less cost actions) path in the network graph env (route planning) greedily using:
        - hybrid tech algorithms like NN, GA and neurofuzzy(ANFIS)
        - none gradient optimization methods like GA and FA
        - gradient optimization methods like stochastic gradient descent 
        - graph theory and heuristic search algorithms like dijkstras, floyd, bellman, DFS, BFS and A*
        - reinforcement learning algorithms like qlearning using mdp and bellman equation with off and on policy methods based on markov decision process and markov chain
        - other algorithms using greedy, dynamic programming, backtracking, divide and conquer, recursive and brute forcing methods
    ➤ greedy heuristic search estimates how close to the final state we are by compute an optimal solution by selecting the lowest regret decision at each step
    ➤ use GNN as a heuristic search to find those features that are related to outcomes for solving tsp
    ➤ define the butterfly effect for the agent to avoid choosing most rewarded path greedily dangerous in a selecting the most reliable node or peer in graph env
