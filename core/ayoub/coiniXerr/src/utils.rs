        ➔ The three causes of data races
            • Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
            • At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
            • There’s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data
        ➔ The three rules of ownership
            • Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its owner.
            • There can only be one owner at a time.
            • When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
        ➔ The two rules of references
            • At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
            • References must always be valid.


        ➔ types bounded to Sync and Send:
            Arc
            Mutex
            RwLock
        ➔ types not bounded to Sync and Send:
            Rc
            RefCell
            Cell



       ➔ in order to move the T between threads T must be bounded to Send and if it wasn't bound to Sync we have to clone it to move it between threads 
          and if it wasn't bound to Clone trait we must put it inside the Arc and to change it inside other thread we must put the Arc-ed type inside 
          the Mutex like mutating the Receiver<T> content inside other threads which must be in form Arc<Mutex<Receiver<T>>> since the Receiver is 
          not bounded to Sync (cause &Receiver is not bouned to Send cause there is no clone trait implemented for the Receiver thus it can't be copy 
          thus we can't have &Receiver and can't be clone) therefore we can't move it between threads due to the fact that the type T (Receiver in our case) 
          must be used by only one consumer or thread at a time by blocking threads waiting for the lock to become available.
       ➔ based on the rust ownership and borrowing rule which removes the need of garabe collection rule we can have multiple immutable references to a type but only one mutable pointer at a time must be exists
          and due to this rule we can have a safe concurrency in such a way that multiple threads can be the owner of a type to read its content but only on of them
          can mutate the content of the type (like reading from the receiver which is a mutable operation) therefore we can have mpsc message passing channel based on this rule
          the sender of the channel is Send but not Sync and can be cloned to send data between threads for reading (multiple producer) but the receiver is not Send and Sync and can't be cloned 
          since it can't be move or transfer to other threads cause the reading process from the receiver is a mutable operation and we can't have multiple mutable operations or references 
          at the same time with multiple threads thus only one thread at a time can do this job.
       ➔ since the reading from the receiver is a mutable process and it can't be cloned thus in order to read from it inside multiple thread we have to write 
          the receiver in form of Arc<Mutex<Receiver<T>>> and lock on the receiver to read the content of what we're receiving.   



        -- shareable rules : data which are Send + Sync + 'static must be share and trasferred between threads using mpsc channel
        -- in rust everything is all about having a type and size thus everything must be generic and we have to borrowing them using & to share them between other scopes like threads and functions a shareable data means we're sharing its references which it can be copied or cloned and safe to Send and mutate between threads
        -- Arc will be used instead of Rc in multi threading to avoid data races and is Send means all its references can be shared between threads and is an atomic reference to a type
        -- if &T is Send then T can be also Sync thus in order to share a data between threads safely the type must be bounded to Send + Sync + 'static means it must be cloneable or shareable between threads means we can simply borrow it to move it between threads and Sync with other threads to avoid mutating it by multiple threads at the same time
        -- if there is no possibility of undefined behavior like data races when passing &T between threads means &T must be Send then T is alos Sync and &mut T is Sync if T is Sync
        -- data which is utf8 encoded using borsh or serde to share a reference of it (by borrowing it) between threads using mpsc must be : Send + Sync + 'static + Unpin means it must be inside Arc<Mutex<Data>>
        -- if a type is not Send + Sync it means we can't move its references between threads safely and we have to put it inside Arc since &Arc<T> is Send thus Arc<T> is Sync thus the type inside the Arc can be sent between threads safely
        -- a type might be mutated by other threads thus we have to put it inside Mutex or RwLock to avoid data races means that only one thread can mutate the state of a type
        -- instead of moving types into the thread we can borrow them using Arc to have them outside the threads
        -- based on mpsc rust has defined the rule which says multiple immutable can be inside a scope but only one of them can be mutable
        -- in order to share data (T must have shareable rules) between threads we have to use mpsc channel 
        -- Send is the access of sharing between threads, Sync is safe to transfer and static means the type must have static lifetime across threads and .awaits
        -- share data between routers and threads using .data() of routerify Router and to do that the passed in closure of the thread must be static + send and sync to send between threads safely we can't just simply borrow the data using & to pass them between threads (since the race condition might be happened) since the type must be send + sync and 'static to be shared between threads safely if it's not send and sync we can put it inside the Arc<Mutex<T>> to make it cloneable and borrow it mutably to mutate its content by locking on it inside a free thread, if other threads don't want to mutate it we can just put it inside Arc<T> to be just cloneable 
        -- share reference or share access means multiple threads can read and access a resource or a type but only on of them can mutate it and the channel for this task is the mpsc
        -- the type that wants to be sent between threads must be Send but not Sync necessarily like sender which is not Sync but it's Send and receiver is not Sync and Send
        -- it's better not to pass the receiver between threads due to the rule of mpsc since we can't mutate a data simply inside a thread while others are reading it we have to block that thread that wants to mutate the type using Mutex
        -- passing data between threads is done using mpsc channel which multiple threads can own a resource immutable referece but only on of them can mutate that resource at a time
        -- to pass data between thread the type must cloneable and sender must be cloned since inside a thread all env vars before that are moved to its scope.
        -- in order to mutate a type inside a thread the type must be inside Mutex since the receiver can't be referenced by multiple threads at a time thus is a single consumer means that it can't be cloned and moved to other threads 
        -- Send means that a type is safe to move from one thread to another
        -- Sync makes the type safe (&T nmust be Send) to access shared reference across threads at the same time 
        -- Clone trait is implemented for the mpsc sender and is bounded to Send but not Sync and due to this reason we have to clone it in order we can have it in multiple threads (multi producer)
        -- Clone trait is not implemented for the mpsc receiver and we must put it inside Arc also is not Sync means it can't be referenced by multiple threads at the same time due to the fact that only one thread can mutate its content at a time (single consumer) thus we have to put it inside a Mutex
        -- in order to pass the receiver between threads safely and mutate its content by locking on it we must put the receiver inside Arc and Mutex like let shareable_receiver = Arc<Mutex<Receiver<T>>> then clone it using Arc::new(&shareable_receiver) or shareable_receiver.clone()

                                          --- the reason that MULT_OF_ALL_SUM must be static ---

                            in this situation we shouldn't mutate any type inside here if the type is not
                            static and doesn't have a valid lifetime across threads.

                            one of the most popular cases of a T: 'static bound is std::thread::spawn
                            the reason there is that the closure and its return value need to be sent between threads, 
                            escaping their call-stack which is why they cannot contain any non-'static references 
                            since these could become invalidated and no longer available in the other thread in the mean-time.

                            if we don't want to send the data from a thread to another one we have to make static to have 
                            valid lifetime across threads also mutating the static types directly is unsafe!

                            due to the single consumer rule only on thread can mutate the received job or the task or the data
                            at a time in order to prevent data racing we've put the Arced (since it's not cloneable due to the single consumer rule) 
                            receiver inside the Mutex to lock on it and change the content of what it has received cause we want 
                            to mutate the data of the receiver inside other threads.

        collection 1 keys : {1: "value64", 2: "value53", 3: "value24"}
        collection 2 keys : {1: "anether", 2: "anither", 3: "another"}
        
        when initializing a data structure we have to make sure to give it a unique id, otherwise, it could point to other structure's key-value references;
        above collections will be collided with each other inside the memory since they share the same storage for their keys and have same keys
        to fix this we can allocate a unique storage key for each collection like binding a unique key for each entry that comes into the collection
        and that unique storage key must be built from a utf8 bytes encoded unique indentifire like an enum variant:

        NOTE - the reason we're using enum is because of by encoding each variant using borsh we'll get a unique vector of utf8 bytes array
        
        #[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize)]
        pub enum CollectStorageKey{
            CollectionOne,
            CollectionTwo,
        }

        collection 1 storage key : 0 ---- built from the utf8 bytes encoded CollectionOne enum variant (CollectStorageKey::CollectionOne.try_to_vec().unwrap())
        collection 2 storage key : 1 ---- built from the utf8 bytes encoded CollectionTwo enum variant (CollectStorageKey::CollectionTwo.try_to_vec().unwrap())
        
        collection 1 keys : {1: "value64", 2: "value53", 3: "value24"} -> put all the keys inside the created storage key for the first collection like: {0: [1, 2, 3]} or as a unique prefix for the keys: {01: "value64", 02: "value53", 03: "value24"}
        collection 2 keys : {1: "anether", 2: "anither", 3: "another"} -> put all the keys inside the created storage key for the second collection like: {1: [1, 2, 3]} or as a unique prefix for the keys: {11: "anether", 12: "anither", 13: "another"}





        NOTE - by setting a unique storage key for each collection actually we're putting all the keys and entries of that collection inside a unique storage in memory which has a unique key or flag to avoid data collision for each collection's keys
        NOTE - since two different collections might have same key we'll set a prefix key for each collection using enum variant serialized to utf8 to avoid collection collision with same key in their entries, by doing this every collection will have a unique identifier and will be separated from other collection in which a same version of a key exists
        NOTE - every instascne of ByOwnerIdInner, ByNFTContractIdInner and ByNFTTokenTypeInner will have a new memory location address thus we can use it as an storage key since the hash of this key will be different and unique each time due to different memory location address of each instacne which won't be the same even if we create a new instance with a same field each time
        NOTE - enum has an extra size like 8 bytes, a 64 bits pointer which is big enough (64 bit arch os) to store the current vairant address for its tag which tells use which variant we have right now, but rust uses null pointer optimization instead of allocating 8 bytes tag  
        NOTE - null pointer optimization means a reference can never be null such as Option<&T> which is a pinter with 8 bytes length thus rust uses that reference or pointer as the tag with 8 bytes length for the current variant  
        NOTE - none struct variants in Storagekey enum allocates zero byte for the current persistent storage once the tag point to their address at a time
        NOTE - the enum size with zero byte for each variants would be the largest size of its variant + 8 bytes tag which would be 8 bytes in overall
        NOTE - an enum is the size of the maximum of its variants plus a discriminant value to know which variant it is, rounded up to be efficiently aligned, the alignment depends on the platform
        NOTE - an enum size is equals to a variant with largest size + 8 bytes tag (there is only one 8 byte tag required since only one variant will be available at the same time)
        NOTE - enum size with a single f64 type variant would be 8 bytes and with four f64 variants would be 16 bytes cause one 8 bytes (the tag) wouldn't be enough because there would be no room for the tag
        NOTE - the size of the following enum is 24 (is equals to its largest variant size which belongs to the Text variant) + 8 (the tag size) bytes 
        
        pub enum UserID {
            Number(u64),
            Text(String),
        }

#[derive(BorshSerialize)] // NOTE - since UnorderedMap, LookupMap and UnorderedSet each one takes a vector of u8 as their key_prefix argument we have to bound the Storagekey enum to BorshSerialize trait to convert each variant into a vector of u8 using try_to_vec() method of the BorshSerialize trait - all collections (i.e. Vector, Map, Tree, etc) have an unique id which is called the storage key and can be either an encoded enum variant or an encoded string
// -> we've used an enum based storage key for better memory efficiency and avoiding data collision to keeps track of the persistent storage taken by the current collection (one of the following variant). 
// -> data collision could happen by UnorderedMap, LookupMap or UnorderedSet since these hashmap based structure generate a hash from their keys. 
// -> in order not to have a duplicate key entry inside hashmap based structures we can use enum to avoid having some hash collision with two distinct keys.
