    //// ➔ ZMQ sockets may be connected to multiple endpoints, while simultaneously accepting incoming connections from 
    ////    multiple endpoints bound to the socket, thus allowing many-to-many relationships.
    // 
    //// ➔ ZMQ contexts are thread safe data types means we can clone them to share between threads (they are Arc-ed) 
    ////    and also they avoid deadlocks since ZMQ socket protocols use actors under the hood means 
    ////    both senders and receivers are actors which use a buit in jobq to handle incoming tasks and jobs. 
    // 
    //// ➔ ZMQ creates queues (actor) per underlying connection of each socket type if your socket is connected to three peer sockets, 
    ////    then there are three messages queues behind the scenes, queues are created as individual peers connect to the bound socket   
    //
    //// ➔ every ZMQ sender and receiver socket type is an actor which sends and receive in parallel manner since actors use worker threadpool
    ////    (like tokio::spawn() worker green based threadpool + tokio channels for sharing messages between threads), 
    ////    job or task queue channels, pub/sub channels for broadcasting messages to other actors, task scheduling 
    ////    and mailbox to communicate with each other under the hood.
    //
    //// ➔ RPC allows us to directyly call methods on other machines and it's a 
    ////    bidirectional full-duplex streaming in which the client can request and 
    ////    the server can respond simultaneously and at the same time.  
    //
    //// ➔ ZMQ patterns are:
    ////      • Request-reply, which connects a set of clients to a set of services. This is a remote procedure call and task distribution pattern.
    ////      • Pub-sub, which connects a set of publishers to a set of subscribers. This is a data distribution pattern.
    ////      • Pipeline, which connects nodes in a fan-out/fan-in pattern that can have multiple steps and loops. This is a parallel task distribution and collection pattern.
    ////      • Exclusive pair, which connects two sockets exclusively. This is a pattern for connecting two threads in a process, not to be confused with “normal” pairs of sockets.
    ////      • Client-server, which allows a single ZMQ server talk to one or more ZMQ clients. The client always starts the conversation, after which either peer can send messages asynchronously, to the other.
    ////      • Radio-dish, which used for one-to-many distribution of data from a single publisher to multiple subscribers in a fan out fashion.
