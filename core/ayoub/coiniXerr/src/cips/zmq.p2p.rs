    //// âž” ZeroMQ sockets may be connected to multiple endpoints, while simultaneously accepting incoming connections from 
    ////    multiple endpoints bound to the socket, thus allowing many-to-many relationships.
    // 
    //// âž” ZMQ contexts are thread safe data types means we can clone them to share between threads (they are Arc-ed) 
    ////    and also they avoid deadlocks since ZMQ socket protocols use actors under the hood means 
    ////    both senders and receivers are actors which use a buit in jobq to handle incoming tasks and jobs. 
    // 
    //// âž” ZeroMQ creates queues (actor) per underlying connection of each socket type if your socket is connected to three peer sockets, 
    ////    then there are three messages queues behind the scenes, queues are created as individual peers connect to the bound socket   
    //
    //// âž” every sender and receiver socket type in ZMQ is an actor since actors use worker threadpool
    ////    (like tokio::spawn() worker green based threadpool + tokio channels for sharing messages between threads), 
    ////    jobq channels, pub/sub channels to communicate with another actor and task scheduling 
    ////    and mailbox to communicate with each other under the hood.
