### ðŸ“Œ WIP 

* complete `rpc.server.rs`, `zmq.p2p.rs` and `tcp.server.rs` streaming

* complete `rpc_tx_emulator` method

* HAProxy, dockerizing, k8s-ing and ci/cd in `app.sh`

* coiniXerr engines, reset slot, mempool channel, runtime log, consensus and block validation process, transaction signature, block and merkle root and wallet address using Argon2 based on `XChaCha20Poly1305` end-to-end encryption

* implementing Rafael runtime and onion actors

* use `tcp_tx_emulator` method to send fake transactions to the coiniXerr nodes through the TCP Protocol

* use `udp_tx_emulator` method to send fake transactions to the coiniXerr nodes through the UDP Protocol

* use `rpc_tx_emulator` method to send fake transactions to the coiniXerr nodes through the RPC Protocol
