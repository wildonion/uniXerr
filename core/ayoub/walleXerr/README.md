coiniXerr Wallet Front-end Written in Yew 

### ðŸ“Œ WIP

* use `build()` method of the `rafael` runtime to build the `wasm` file of the app like cloudflare and shuttle runtime to load the wasm file in js

* users can send transaction from this wallet to the coiniXerr server for mining processes

* use `tx_emulator` method to send fake transactions to the coiniXerr server through the tcp socket

* add `XChaCha20Poly1305` end-to-end encryption for socket tls and ssl (like using certbot) between walleXerr and the coiniXerr streaming protocols
