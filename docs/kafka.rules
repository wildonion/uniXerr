kafka => multiple cluster (datacenter or VPS) <-has-> nodes(multiple instances of kafka brokers or servers) <-has-> topics <-has-> partition replicas for each topic <-has-> buck of events inside each partition
three replicas in kafka means there are three copies of each topics' partitions (buck of events) in each node (kafka broker)
kafka partitions are created based on the hash of each event and events with similar hash will be inside a same partition so a topic is divided into one or more partitions
the default number of partitions in kafka for each topic is 10
