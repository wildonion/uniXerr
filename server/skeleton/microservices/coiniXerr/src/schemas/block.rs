// NOTE - all fields of a union share common storage and writes to one field of a union can overwrite its other fields, and size of a union is determined by the size of its largest field
// NOTE - there is no way for the compiler to guarantee that you always read the correct type (that is, the most recently written type) from the union
// NOTE - enums use some extra memory to keep track of the enum variant, with unions we keep track of the current active field ourself
