// NOTE - all coiniXerr coin holders are uniXerr community members called participants known as validator actors
// NOTE - validator actors can issue contracts by staking some coins from their coiniXerr balance which can be deposited based on their smart contract tokens (CRC20) ExpTime field
// NOTE - validator actors get rewarded based on total values of their contracts and an AI based algorithm which is position clustering coin generation model
// TODO - compile coiniXerr node to wasm to run in browser through the loading process of .wasm or .js compiled file
// TODO - declarative macros are written using macro_rules!
// TODO - procedural macros are custom derive: #[derive(CustomDerive)], attribute-like: #[CustomAttribute], and function-like: custom!(...)
// TODO - different kind of arguments passing structure with arbitrary numbers of them using macros
// TODO - substrate FT and NFT ink! smart contracts on local chain or full node
